You don't speak German? Sorry about that.

F5                - toggle resolution
F6                - Screenshot
F12               - Toggle mute sound/music
Alt + Enter       - Toggle fullscreen
Esc               - Menu / skip dialogs
For listening to the ingame music please install the OGG driver OggDS0995.exe included in this archive.


CAN YOU GET THIS TO A GOOD END?
